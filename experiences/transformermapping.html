              <b>Electricity</b>, is arguably one of the crucial basic amenities needed by humanity. At the <a href="https://futa.edu.ng"> Federal University of Technology, Akure(FUTA)</a>,students living on the
              University campus enjoys,to some extent,stable electricity which rumor has it
              that the University management partnered with the electricity distribution
              company,well,maybe or maybe not,but the fact remains that the electricity on
              campus is more stable and reliable than that of the off-campus. So, how then
              can the students staying off campus get to enjoy this supposed basic amenity?
              As it’s a very crucial basic amenity for their livelihood. This problem has been identified by <a href="https://upnepa.ng"> Energy Detectors Technologies Limited</a>,a fast growing startup focused on remote data collection, analysis and
              visualization in the energy sectors with the use of IoT technology and
              advanced algorithms, are trying in our best capacity to curb this challenge and
              one of the ways we can is the transformer mapping project we embarked on. Knowing that problem solving projects like this requires accurate field data
              collection,we partnered with <a href="https://twitter.com/YouthMappersFUTA"> YouthMappersFUTA </a>, a university based student
              led community that transforms their communities through mapping, in order
              to also fast track our data collection in record time frame. Geographic Information Technology approach was adopted.<br>
               GIS provides a better scenario in the management and monitoring of electricity distribution facilities so as to provide adequate power supply for the resident sector of the economy.<br>
              The aim of the project was collect accurate in-situ data of all electricity
              transformers in FUTA environment by leveraging modern mobile data
              collection applications that was provided by the company with the purpose of
              improving the status-quo from a data driven approach.

              This was carried out by locating and mapping all the facilities involved in
                distributing energy to the end-users. Further analyses such as determining the
                trend/pattern of the rate in consumption of energy by the households within
                the study area would be performed afterwards. Areas of short-comings would
                also be identified and proposed locations/sites would be generated in the
                service areas that needs new facilities.<br></p>

                <h2>PROJECT OBJECTIVES</h2> <br>
                <p>
                <ol>
                <li>Mapping out all electricity transformers delivering power to those living
                within the environment of FUTA<li>
                <li>Estimating the number of individuals/houses feeding from each transformer.</li>
                <li>Implementing a real time monitoring system which will remotely aggregate
                data from all identifies areas feed by different transformers. </li>
                <li>Making of some basic analysis which informs both electricity distributors
                and the users. The objectives were categorized into two phases of which phase one is about data collection on site (1&2) and phase two was the collection of point of
                contacts information (3&4)</li>
              </ol>
              </p>

                <h2>PROJECT TASKS</h2>
                <p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Acquire point data of all electrical step down transformers within FUTA
                Environment</li>
                <li>Acquire point data of all electrical step down transformers within FUTA
                Environment</li>
                <li>Street / area name where transformers are located</li>
                <li>Other neighbouring areas feed by transformer</li>
                <li>3 - 5 locations powered by identified transformer where smart monitoring
                devices can be deployed. This locations could be either</li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                 <li>A personal shop/office (e.g small sales shop, hubs, kiosk etc),</li>

                  <li> b) Or public facilities (e.g mosque, church, town hall etc)</li>
                </ul>
              </p> <br>

                <h2>HUMAN RESOURCES</h2>
                <p>
                During the course of the project, 12 field workers,who are active members
                of the YouthMappersFUTA community, were deployed on the field and
                provided with base maps of FUTA and its environs as well as necessary
                training on how to use the mobile application, in order to collect both the
                location data and some specified attributes information that were cleared
                stated in the project description accurately.</p>
                <h2>SOFTWARE AND HARDWARD USED</h2>
                <ol>
                 <li>GPS Enabled Android Powered Mobile Phones</li>
                <li>Point Collector Mobile Application</li>
                </ol>
                <h2> PROJECT TIMELINE</h2> <br>
                The first phase of the project was a week long exercise(March 3
                rd - March 10th,2020)<br>
                The second phase was a week long exercise (March 10th - March 15th,2020)<br>
                
                <h2>DATA COLLECTED AND FINDINGS</h2>
                <p>
                Although,the data collected on the field by field workers were been synced to
                the cloud almost immediately after collection,we were still able to find out that
                there are very few transformers in FUTA environment and this can be
                connected to the reason why we not only often experience low current of
                electricity distribution but also days of no electricity.</p>
